# CubeCraft_Profile_Checker
Being able to see what your profile will look like without uploading it directly to the cubecraft forums

Firstly, Add this chrome extension to your browser: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cubeprofilescanner/fjchilbpmnbokjamogemggbgheplmkij?hl=nl

Then, go to a cubecraft profile and click on the extension, it will download a JSON file which you can upload on the site.

You can also make your own profile by playing around with everything that's on the website including profile picture, banner, and roles.
